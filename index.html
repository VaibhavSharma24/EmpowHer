      <h3 id="title_sub">Why We Do</h3>
      <p>When women are empowered and treated equally, it leads to a more just and equitable society. Gender equality and women empowerment can lead to greater economic growth, improved health and well-being, reduced poverty and inequality, and increased political participation and decision-making power. Empowering women means unlocking their potential, which can lead to significant benefits not only for women themselves but for entire communities and societies.</p>
